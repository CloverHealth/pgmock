    "### Configuring for Accuracy and Performance\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Safe Mode\n",
    "``pgmock`` searches SQL with regular expressions. Regular expressions can get tripped up whenever special characters appear in comments of SQL or in string literals. For example, ``-- this is my comment; hello!`` will mess up ``pgmock.statement`` since it splits the SQL by the semicolon character. Turning on **safe mode** will search a pre-formatted version of the supplied SQL that is stripped of comments and string literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Safe mode can be turned on with ``pgmock.config.set_safe_mode``. By default, it is set to ``False`` because it incurs a major performance hit when using it. Safe mode doesn't have to be configured globally with ``pgmock.config.set_safe_mode``. It can be passed to ``pgmock.sql`` or ``pgmock.sql_file`` as an argument. It can also be used in a context manager so that it is only set during the duration of execution like so:"

    "#### Replace New Patch Aliases\n",
    "Since ``pgmock`` turns expressions into ``VALUES`` expressions when patching, it is not always possible to preserve the original name of what's being patched. For example, ``SELECT * from schema.table_name`` is impossible to patch as ``SELECT * FROM (VALUES ...) AS schema.table_name`` since ``schema.table_name`` is not a valid alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this case happens in the case of the ``pgmock.table`` selector, ``pgmock`` will make an alias as the table name and then replace any refences to the old table name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, ``SELECT schema.table_name.col FROM schema.table_name`` would be replaced with ``SELECT table_name.col FROM (VALUES ...) AS table_name(...)``. Note that this only matters when the full schema and table name is used to reference columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, this mode is turned on. To turn it off globally, call ``pgmock.config.set_replace_new_patch_aliases(False)``. Similar to ``pgmock.config.set_safe_mode``, this function can be used as a context manager or in a pytest fixture. It can also be given as an argument to ``pgmock.mock`` since SQLAlchemy will use this style of selects by default when making a ``sqlalchemy.insert`` object from a table with a schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "If users are never using the full schema and table name when referencing columns, it is safe to turn this option off and will improve ``pgmock.table`` selector performance by about 20%."
