"""
This file illustrates a few examples of using pgmock with pytest.

A postgres testing database from pytest-pgsql (https://github.com/CloverHealth/pytest-pgsql)
is used and a fixture is created for using the mock context manager. This is the
preferred way of using pgmock, but it's also possible to render SQL yourself and execute
patched versions of it. Examples of this are also included here
